    description= _ "Blood Warriors are savage bloodthirsty orcs, driven by a singular purpose – to slaughter everything in their path. These elite Barbarian berserkers from the Barbarian faction charge into battle with no regard for their own safety, relying on their rage and martial prowess to overcome almost any obstacle. 

Wielding twin gauntlet-mounted blades, they strike with lightning speed and merciless efficiency, tearing through ranks of foes without hesitation. Their eyes gleam with bloodlust, fueled by a never-ending thirst for violence; once engaged, they become an unstoppable force of nature, relentless in their pursuit of victory. 

Even after vanquishing an adversary, the Blood Warrior does not rest – he continues to press forward, seeking fresh blood add to his already impressive tally of kills."
