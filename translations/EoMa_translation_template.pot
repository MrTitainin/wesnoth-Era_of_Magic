After about a decade of observing, imitating, and stealing from various kinds of magi he encountered, he started figuring out patterns of spellcasting. Upon his return, his newfound powers attracted many a follower among goblins, who wanted to learn this outlandish skill. Most of them failed to learn even the basics, but some succeeded, and then started spreading this knowledge across the wasteland, long after their master's death, starting a chain reaction that started from a single goblin, and turned into an entire cult. These so-called goblin shamans aren't very common, but plentiful enough to be often seen in the rear of barbarian hordes, acting as healers and advisors."

While brown warriors sacrifice their agility in favor of armor and brute force, silver warriors combine agility and light magic, giving them rather unique abilities. They are capable of teleporting between friendly villages, utilizing their combined soul power. This allows them to quickly dart between parts of the battle field, making it harder to flank Kharosian forces. They also wield glowing swords which have been enchanted by light magic, instead of the normal ones, making them more effective against various spawns of darkness, or magical beings. It also allows them to shoot weak magical missiles at their foes, which are generally used to defend against enemy archers of magi."

Normally such a weapon would be very impractical, so it has been enchanted to dynamically redistribute the weight according to the guardian's needs."

It's speculated that the Destroyers were created a long time ago as a weapon, which broke out of control at some point. This could explain the Cataclysm, an event which almost wiped out all life on the planet in ancient times. While most of these abominations have been wiped out by the Runemasters, their remnants are still roaming the North Pole. It's rumored that these beings are the same ones the Tharis worship."
