#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_SKYKINGDOM
_"The Sky Kingdom is an enigmatic civilization of mages. They live on flying isles, which move along with the wind, and give the magi a great view of the surface. When flying over nations, they usually stop to observe, and sometimes trade. Their civilization is considered to be one of the most advanced on the planet, and values scientific progress above all else. They are known for experiments with nature and cosmic matter, yet they don't reveal their motives to others."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_SUMMONERS
_"The proud people of al-Kamija inhabit the Great Desert. They often refer themselves as Summoners. The reason for that is once upon a time, their ancestors discovered the Abyss, a different dimension full of untamed power that can be tapped into via magical circles. The main implication of this newfound power was summoning elemental beings and magical entities. Those strange dwellers of the Abyss proved to be loyal to the Summoners, and fulfill whatever desires the summoners have. With the help of these beings, the people of al-Kamija have created a nearly utopian society."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_THARIS
_"The cruel warlords and sovereigns of the East, Tharis are descendants of an ancient tribe that practiced dark magic. This irreversibly affected their physical appearance, and twisted their minds. Being true masters of occult arts, great warlocks of this nation can cast some of the most bizarre spells known to humankind. Tharis worship the Great Destroyers, mysterious legendary undead beings, believing that by slaughtering other nations they, they will be spared by their deities during their foretold return. It is rumored their cult is also centered around an enigmatic artifact called the Eye of Darkness..."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_KHAROS
_"Kharosians are a mostly peaceful nation of common people and clerics worshiping the Sun. In fact, they are all descendants of the Sun Cult, a tribe who managed to subjugate other tribes in the dark times. Kharosian warriors and clerics use light magic, which is transmitted to them via the Sun Ray - a powerful ancient artifact, whose location has been sworn never to be revealed by the Kharosians. The artifact's magic allows them to quickly heal wounds, and even teleport short distances."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_BARBARIANS
_"Southwest of the Great Desert are barren wastelands - a harsh, unforgiving land, yet which is home for many different creatures: Tiny goblins, barbaric orcs, mysterious trolls and even mighty cyclopes. They originally were independent and constantly fought for survival, but recently, something made them unite against the Darkblooded, forming the so-called 'Great Horde'. It could be due to the Jungle of Life's vast resources, it could be due to some old grudge, it could be something entirely else..."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_DARKBLOOD
_"At the edge of the Great Desert lies a sacred land - The Jungle of Life. This mysterious place is inhabited by one of the oldest civilizations on the planet - the Darkblooded. Their nation is rather diverse: sneaky salamanders, majestic wyverns, huge toads and clans of lizards - all living in a perfect harmony with nature. But there is also a Great Bog - a place filled with darkness, where corrupted shamans and other exiled creatures worship pure chaos..."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_RUNEMASTERS
_"A long time ago, there was a magnificent civilization of Runemasters. They lived in isolation at the North Pole, extracting power crystals - the source of energy for their mechanical creations like steam robots, tanks and even flying mechanical dragons. The Runemasters were the last nation to face the Destroyers' killing spree, and thanks to these stunning constructs, managed to stop the enemy, but at a great cost. The dwarves are now considered almost extinct, yet their machines still function, and guard their ancient lands to this day."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_DESTROYERS
_"Little is known about these powerful undead beings. They are fueled by anti-magic, and consist of the remnants of long-forgotten civilizations, once consumed by the chaotic swarm. It's speculated that the Destroyers were created a long time ago as a weapon, which broke out of control at some point. This could explain the Cataclysm, an event which almost wiped out all life on the planet in ancient times. While most of these abominations have been wiped out by the Runemasters, their remnants are still roaming the North Pole. It's rumored that these beings are the same ones the Tharis worship."#enddef
